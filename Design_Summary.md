# Mentoring Platform - Design Documentation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Mentoring Platform application, including both High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) documentation. The platform is a web-based application that facilitates 1-on-1 video mentoring sessions between mentors and mentees using WebRTC technology.

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.2.3 with Java 17
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Real-time Communication**: WebRTC + WebSocket (STOMP)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with Spring Security

### System Components
1. **React Client** - User interface and WebRTC client
2. **Spring Boot Server** - REST APIs and WebSocket signaling
3. **PostgreSQL Database** - Data persistence
4. **WebRTC** - Peer-to-peer video communication

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. User Management
- User registration and authentication with BCrypt password hashing
- Role-based access control (MENTOR/MENTEE)
- JWT token-based session management with localStorage persistence
- Profile management for mentors with expertise, hourly rates, and descriptions
- Form validation and error handling

### 2. Session Management
- Session booking and scheduling with availability checking
- Availability management for mentors with day-of-week and time slots
- Session status tracking (PENDING, CONFIRMED, REJECTED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED, NO_SHOW)
- Session history and upcoming sessions for both mentors and mentees
- Session cancellation and status updates

### 3. Real-time Video Communication
- WebRTC peer-to-peer video calls with ICE servers for NAT traversal
- WebSocket signaling using STOMP protocol over SockJS
- Media stream management (audio/video) with device access
- Call controls (mute, video toggle, screen sharing)
- Session-based room management for secure connections
- Connection resilience with ICE restart, signaling reconnect (exponential backoff), and peer connection recreation

### 4. Real-time Chat Communication
- Session-based real-time text messaging
- WebSocket-based chat using STOMP protocol
- Message persistence during session duration
- Sender identification and timestamp display
- Connection status indicators
- Message validation and error handling

### 5. Mentor Discovery
- Browse available mentors with detailed profiles
- Filter by expertise, availability, and ratings
- View mentor profiles with expertise, hourly rates, and descriptions
- Book sessions with selected mentors with time slot selection
- Real-time availability checking

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
1. **users** - User accounts and profiles
2. **user_roles** - Role assignments (MENTOR/MENTEE)
3. **sessions** - Session bookings and details
4. **availabilities** - Mentor availability schedules

### Key Relationships
- Users can have multiple roles
- Sessions link mentors and mentees
- Availability slots belong to mentors
- Sessions have various statuses and types

## API Design

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /monitoringPlatform/auth/signup` - User registration with role selection
- `POST /monitoringPlatform/auth/login` - User authentication with JWT token
- `GET /monitoringPlatform/auth/me` - Get current user details

### Session Management Endpoints
- `POST /monitoringPlatform/sessions/book` - Book a session with mentor
- `POST /monitoringPlatform/sessions/availability` - Get available time slots
- `GET /monitoringPlatform/sessions/upcoming` - Get upcoming sessions
- `GET /monitoringPlatform/sessions/history` - Get session history
- `PUT /monitoringPlatform/sessions/{id}/status` - Update session status (mentor only)
- `PUT /monitoringPlatform/sessions/{id}/cancel` - Cancel session

### Profile Management Endpoints
- `GET /monitoringPlatform/mentors` - Get all available mentors
- `GET /monitoringPlatform/mentor/profile` - Get mentor profile
- `PUT /monitoringPlatform/mentor/profile` - Update mentor profile

## WebRTC Implementation

### Signaling Protocol
- **Message Types**: offer, answer, candidate, join, leave
- **Transport**: WebSocket with STOMP protocol over SockJS
- **ICE Servers**: Google STUN servers for NAT traversal
- **Session Management**: Room-based connections using session IDs

### Connection Flow
1. WebSocket connection establishment via STOMP
2. Local media stream initialization with device permissions
3. Offer/Answer exchange for session establishment
4. ICE candidate exchange for network connectivity
5. Peer-to-peer media streaming with audio/video controls
6. Session-based room management for secure connections
7. Resilience: Automatic ICE restart and signaling reconnection with exponential backoff; deterministic initiator prevents glare; peer connection recreation with local track re-attachment

## Chat Implementation

### Chat Protocol
- **Message Types**: Text messages with sender and timestamp
- **Transport**: WebSocket with STOMP protocol over SockJS
- **Session-based**: Messages scoped to specific session IDs
- **Real-time**: Instant message delivery between participants

### Chat Flow
1. Chat component initializes with session ID
2. WebSocket connection established for chat messaging
3. Subscribe to session-specific chat topic
4. Real-time message exchange between participants
5. Messages displayed with sender identification and timestamps
6. Connection status monitoring and error handling
